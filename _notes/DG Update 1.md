title: DG Update 1

**Date Published: August 11th 2024**

I can't  remember how I stumbled on the work of Maggie Appleton and the concept of digital gardens. What I won't forget is how excited I felt  when I looked through Maggie's site for the first time and read about the ethos of digital gardening. It's a rather niche thing, and I'd be rather shocked if more than a few people ever saw my corner of the internet. But it's mine to cultivate and to grow. Through that process, I want to document my challenges and triumphs here.

So far, setting up this site was easier than I thought it would be. It's a far cry from other setups but it works as a minimal viable product. That ease was completely attributable to the guides I followed and prescient Stack Overflow threads from the days of yore. When I have some more time, I'll collate those in this post. 

Having gotten this minimal viable digital garden set up, there's a few 'next steps' I have in mind:
- **Learn more about Jekyll.** This site is being built of a template created with Jekyll and I feel that I will need to better understand Jekyll as I start to build out this site. I do feel that eventually Jekyll will not be able to provide the functionality I need. However, that's not going to be for a decent while, if at all.

- **Fix links.** A major impetus for my creation of a live website was the ability to aggregate links to interesting internet locales. I think links are amazing and mysterious and fun. It's something the internet needs more of. I've tried posting some in [[Digital Spelunking]] but they aren't working. I need to figure out why and how to fix it.

- **Clean up landing page.** The current landing page needs a little filling out as it's still mostly the same as the one provided by the template. I think I need to add a preface or explanation. 

- **Published and updated.** Maggie Appleton's site has a 'date published' and 'date updated' value for each page she has created. I believe it's auto-updated when she writes, but I'm unsure. I want to dig into her code and see if I can figure out how she created that functionality and try to emulate it here. It's important to have that functionality because I am hoping to treat notes as living and growing entities that I re-visit and iterate on. Working in public. Having an 'date updated' value helps enforce that ethos. 

- **Front matter.**  Based off the guides I've read, Jekyll needs the front matter to contain the exact title of the post in order to work correctly. I've used the triple dash as indicated by the guide but that's caused the front matter to load into the site in a funny way. I want to figure out how to have the correct front matter without it appearing on posts. I believe that I need to change the quotation marks somehow.
